# Spark-RawData

#### Description:
This repository holds all of the data for the Spark project. There are two main folders: TimeAndMemory and ProofOfConcept. ProofOfConcept holds the all input and output files to show that Spark produces the same result as HFold given the same input. Alternative structures do exist -- as such, the energy was used as the metric for correctness. TimeAndMemory shows the comparison between Spark and HFold when observing time (s) and memory (KB).
